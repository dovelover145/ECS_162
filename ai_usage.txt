ChatGPT was used. It gave a good way to represent the parameters of the URL without
having to manually change the URL string every time. Using good abstractions (like URL and
URLSearchParams) makes coding easier.

Chatgpt is used for getting the basic idea of comments logic(how to display them)
Also it give a sence of what to write tests. The way I use chatgpt is when I
try to implement some function, I will let GPT to give some suggestions and some sample code
taht not directly related to the hw but will give a sense on how they looks like.
