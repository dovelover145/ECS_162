Stack Overflow:
    -How to get the date in Javascript and insert it into an HTML file

I used ChatGPT. It's good at explaining how to do things. It's less useful for debugging.
I tried to figure out an issue, but ended up looking online and figured out that I needed to
set the wrapping attribute to "nowrap". I think ChatGPT and other LLMs are useful for learning
programming languages when compared to other resources.

    -Introduction to Jest: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgnxcUQ5vho

I used ChatGPT. It gave a good way to represent the parameters of the URL without
having to manually change the URL string every time. I also learned unit testing with
Jest, along with mocking fetch. It was useful. Using good abstractions (like URL and
URLSearchParams) makes coding easier.
